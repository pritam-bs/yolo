# yolo

A new Flutter project that dynamically adjusts YOLO inference parameters based on real-time system metrics.

## Features

- **Dynamic YOLO Inference Optimization**: The application monitors the device's system health (RAM usage, thermal state and battery level) and dynamically adjusts the YOLO inference parameters, including streaming configuration, confidence threshold, IoU threshold, and the number of items threshold. This ensures optimal performance and resource utilization across varying system loads.
